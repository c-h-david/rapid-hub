# Running RAPID

## Getting Started with Execution

To run RAPID, you'll need to prepare your input data and configure the model parameters. The following resources will help you get started:

## Sample Data

Download sample input/output data to test your RAPID installation:

### San Antonio and Guadalupe River Basins (Texas)
Download all input and output data from David et al. (2011, JHM). These include NHDPlus river network connectivity, lateral inflow from the land surface (computed with Noah-MP) and gage measurements (from USGS NWIS) for a 4-year run (between 2004-01-01 and 2007-12-30).

### SIM-France Domain
Download all input and output data from David et al. (2011, HP). These include SIM-France river network connectivity, inflow from the land surface (computed with ISBA), bilateral inflow from groundwater (computed with MODCOU) for a 10-year run (between 1995-08-01 and 2005-07-31).
