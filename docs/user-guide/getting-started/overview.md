# Overview

## What is RAPID?

The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) is a river network routing model. Given external inflow to rivers, this model can compute the flow of water everywhere in river networks made out of many thousands of reaches using a matrix-based version of the Muskingum method.

## Core Capabilities

RAPID provides the following capabilities:

- **River Network Routing**: Computes discharge for thousands of river reaches simultaneously
- **Matrix-Based Muskingum Method**: Efficient sparse matrix implementation for fast computation
- **NetCDF4 I/O**: Reads and writes scientific data in standard NetCDF format
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based configuration for easy setup and reproducibility
- **Python Implementation**: Modern, well-documented Python codebase with type hints

## Getting Help

This website contains [documents](../tutorials/documents.md), a [link to the source code](https://github.com/c-h-david/rapid2/) as well as resources that should allow you to get started with using RAPID.

The [publications](../../about/publications.md) also contain a lot of valuable information about RAPID's methodology and applications.
