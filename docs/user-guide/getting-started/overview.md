# Overview

## What is RAPID?

The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) is a river routing model that computes flow and volume of water in river networks using a matrix version of the Muskingum method.

## Core Capabilities

RAPID provides the following capabilities:
- Simulation of river flow and water volume
- Parameter estimation for optimal model performance
- Data assimilation for improved accuracy
- High-performance parallel computing support

## Getting Help

This website contains [documents](../tutorials/documents.md), a [link to the source code](https://github.com/c-h-david/rapid/) as well as resources that should allow you to get started with using RAPID.

The [publications](../../about/publications.md) also contain a lot of valuable information about RAPID's methodology and applications.
