## About RAPID

The Routing Application for Parallel computatIon of Discharge (RAPID) is a river network routing model. Given external inflow to rivers, this model can compute the flow of water everywhere in river networks made out of many thousands of reaches. Using a matrix version of the Muskingum method, RAPID can be adapted to any river network with basic connectivity information.

**Open Source & Free**  
RAPID is available under the Berkeley Software Distribution 3-clause license, making it free for academic and commercial use.

**Community Support**  
Access comprehensive documentation, training materials, and connect with the RAPID community for support and collaboration.
